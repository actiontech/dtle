// MemDB is rollbackable Red-Black Tree optimized for transaction states buffer use scenario.
// You can think MemDB is a combination of two separate tree map, one for key => value and another for key => keyFlags.
//
// The value map is rollbackable, that means you can use the `Staging`, `Release` and `Cleanup` API to safely modify KVs.
//
// The flags map is not rollbackable. There are two types of flag, persistent and non-persistent.
// When discarding a newly added KV in `Cleanup`, the non-persistent flags will be cleared.
// If there are persistent flags associated with key, we will keep this key in node without value.
